# Cognitive Biases RAG Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions about cognitive biases using content from a reference PDF (`Cognitive-Biases_V4.pdf`).  
It combines semantic search with a large language model (Google Gemini) to generate accurate, source-backed answers.

  - **BLEU score** â€” measures word overlap with reference answers.
  - **Semantic similarity** â€” measures meaning similarity using SBERT embeddings.
- **Interactive UI** â€” Built with [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) for an easy web-based interface.
